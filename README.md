# Flight-Prediction-System
A flight prediction system using the real-world data-set. I used pandas, sci-learn, numpy and matplotlib libraries of python in this project. I applied Random Forest algorithm along-with Support Vector Machine and Linear regression. According to my observations, random forest algorithm produced the most accurate result.
